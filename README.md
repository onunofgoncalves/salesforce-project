# Product List - LWC

## Overview  
The **ProductList** Lightning Web Component (LWC) fetches and displays products stored in the **Product__c** Salesforce object. It allows users to search, filter by brand and category, view stock details, and access individual product records in Salesforce.  

This component also integrates with an external API ([dummyjson.com/products](https://dummyjson.com/products)) to fetch product data, which is then stored in Salesforce.

## Author Comment  

During the development of this LWC, I successfully integrated the external API ([dummyjson.com/products](https://dummyjson.com/products)) to retrieve and store product data in Salesforce.  

Since I haven't previously implemented authenticated API calls within a Salesforce LWC, I decided to proceed with an **open API connection** to ensure the core functionality of the component‚Äîsuch as product retrieval, filtering, and record navigation‚Äîwas fully operational.  
This approach allowed me to focus on the **main requirements** of the exercise without introducing potential issues that could disrupt the component's performance.  

That said, I have reviewed the **authentication methods** provided by the API, including **Bearer Token authentication** via the `/auth/login` endpoint. Given more time or guidance, I would be eager to implement secure authentication properly, ensuring that API requests are **authorized** while maintaining best practices in Salesforce Apex and LWC security.  

I appreciate the opportunity to work on this and would be happy to discuss potential improvements or authentication implementation strategies in the future.  

**Best regards,**
